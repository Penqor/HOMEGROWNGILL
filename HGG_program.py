"""
Home Grown Gill
 is a local business that wants to computerise their boxed food orders for click and collect options.
 Specifically, they want to be able to enter customer details, specific items ordered and pick-up or delivery
 requirements into a computer while displaying their wares at a farmerâ€™s market (which they do every weekend)
  and have this program display the delivery details, itemised order, and total cost, which can then be printed off.
  Follow up orders generally consist of a specific box size (small, medium, large) with chosen items from a database
  that changes weekly (fruits, veggies, milk products, nuts, jams and juices).  Your task is to create a PROTOTYPE
  program to emphasize the usability of such an application which can be used by customers at a market.



  Decomposition:
  1: Create menu(dictionary)
  1.5: Allow items to be added to menu
  2: Ask for name and address
  2.5 Allow people to order and store the order
  2.75 Allow parts of the order to be deleted
  2.8 Calculate Price
  3: Pickup and delivery functions
  3.5 Create system so user can choose what to do
  4: Box Size
  5: Present Menu
  6: Present final order with details

    Do:
    make a loop function
